# RSAC Comprehensive Testing Plan

## Phase 1: Core Algorithm Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for digital root computation
- [ ] Unit tests for symbolic reduction loops
- [ ] Unit tests for signature generation (both Python and vectorized)
- [ ] Correctness tests: verify RSAC finds same solutions as brute force
- [ ] Edge case tests: empty clauses, unit clauses, pure literals

## Phase 2: Performance Benchmarking
- [ ] SAT scaling tests (n=8 to n=24+)
- [ ] Different clause densities (sparse vs dense)
- [ ] Different k-SAT variants (2-SAT, 3-SAT, 4-SAT, 5-SAT)
- [ ] Memory usage profiling
- [ ] Time complexity analysis
- [ ] Bucket distribution analysis across problem sizes

## Phase 3: Stress Testing
- [ ] Long-running stability tests
- [ ] Random seed variation tests (1000+ different seeds)
- [ ] Pathological case generation (hard SAT instances)
- [ ] Competition SAT instances from SATLIB
- [ ] Unsatisfiable instance handling
- [ ] Large instance tests (n=50, n=100 if feasible)

## Phase 4: Algorithm Variants
- [ ] Different reduction functions (beyond digital root)
- [ ] Alternative signature schemes
- [ ] Hybrid approaches (RSAC + DPLL, RSAC + CDCL)
- [ ] Parallel bucket search
- [ ] Adaptive bucket ordering strategies

## Phase 5: Generalization Tests
- [ ] Graph coloring problems
- [ ] Subset sum problems
- [ ] Knapsack variants
- [ ] Other NP-complete problems

## Phase 6: Production Readiness
- [ ] Error handling and robustness
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Memory leak detection
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)
